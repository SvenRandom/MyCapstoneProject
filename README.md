This project is to develop an IOS application to help buyer agents to manage their business better and help people to find cheapest products around them. The major functions include:
1. Search (Can return the product's price from multiple retailers)
2. Profit Model (User could set and apply it to shopping cart)
3. Shopping cart (Calculate cost in Australia dollars and quote in Chinese Yuan automatically)
4. Search Radar (System will search retailers around user's real-time location and return a list of retailers with promotions at the moment)
5. Special Notification
6. Transaction History
7. Financial Performance
(It uses Xamarin.Formsï¼Œwhich allows developers to write a mobile application in C# that works across all three major platforms)
